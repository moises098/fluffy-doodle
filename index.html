  <h1>Nike</h1>
  <p class=wow>The world's largest athletic apparel company, Nike is best known for its footwear, apparel, and equipment. Founded
    in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, the company became Nike in 1971 after the Greek goddess of victory. One of the most
    valuable brands among sport businesses, Nike employs over 76,000 people worldwide.Nike products are made in
    factories that aren't actually owned by the company itself. Instead, contractors own the factories and Nike pays
    them to produce the goods. The Air Jordan 1 was made famous by basketball player Michael Jordan; however, Jordan
    hated the colors red and black when he first saw the shoes.</p>
